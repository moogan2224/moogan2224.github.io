I am worried I won't have enough time to finish it</p>

                        <p class="blogSpace">I'm also working on creating the actual baseball cards out of pokemon cards. <br>Having to worry about printing and such is too time-consuming and expensive compared to simply creating them myself.</p>

                        <p>I'm working on a form that'll help consolidate information for the meet-the-crew posts instead of handing the raw data from an excel sheet.</p>

                        <p>Following the revival of Aggie Bonfire as Student Bonfire, the Neeley Bonfire Crew (Neeley for short) remains fairly active. I reached out to Neeley's 2024 leadership (Backbreaker, Shrek, Kratos, Sub Zero, and Tomahawk) looking to increase their crew recruitment and retention rates. This will be a branding refresh; increasing their social media presence; and designing and photographing merchandise.</p>
                        <p>Over the winter break, I gave myself a headstart recreating the official logo with variations, choosing typography and colors, business cards, and deciding the themes</p>
                        <p>This week I created sketches for a tshirt design, reached out to my new mentor, Martin Hooper of Drifting Creatives, created some reuseable background and accent assets, worked on the meet the chiefs post, created my pitch, interviewed the man who brought back bonfire post collapse, reached out to other prominent members of bonfire leadership, and starting the blog</p>
